# File Compression System Using Huffman Encoding

**File Compression System Using Huffman Encoding** is a robust Java application designed to efficiently compress and decompress files using Huffman encoding. This lossless data compression technique ensures that files are reduced in size without any loss of information, making it ideal for both storage and transmission.

## Key Features

- **Huffman Encoding:** Employs Huffman Tree and encoding algorithms for effective file compression.
- **Graphical User Interface:** User-friendly GUI (`EncoderGUI.java`) for seamless interaction with the application.
- **Custom Data Structures:** Implements specialized data structures like singly linked lists and priority queues to optimize compression tasks.
- **Progress Tracking:** Visual progress bar to monitor the status of compression and decompression processes.

## Technologies

This application utilizes the following technologies:
- **Java:** Core programming language for implementing the compression algorithms and GUI.
- **Swing/AWT:** For creating the graphical user interface.
- **Custom Data Structures:** Designed specifically for the compression and encoding tasks.
